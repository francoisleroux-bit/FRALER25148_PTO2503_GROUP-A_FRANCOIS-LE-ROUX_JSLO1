# Kanban Board UI Project

This project has been a truly **interesting and rewarding challenge** for me. From the very beginning, I knew this would be a great opportunity to grow and practice my front-end development skills. One of the things I enjoy most is implementing everything **step by step**, carefully crafting each element with attention to detail and design accuracy.

## ðŸ§© Project Structure & Progress

I structured my GitHub commits to reflect **distinct development phases**. Each commit represents a specific milestone in the creation process:

- **First Commit:**  
  I focused solely on the **overall layout**, setting up the structure, font sizes, and implementing the **color scheme** as per the design. This gave me a solid foundation to work from and helped ensure consistency across the board.

- **Subsequent Phases:**  
  From there, I moved into more interactive elements. One of the most **exciting parts** was bringing the **popup modal** to life â€” seeing how it appears, animates, and adjusts on different screen sizes truly made the UI feel dynamic and modern.

- **Responsiveness:**  
  As I refined the responsiveness for both **desktop and mobile** (particularly iPhone SE dimensions), it was incredibly satisfying to watch the layout adapt smoothly, not exactly as intended, but happy with the result.

## âœ¨ What I Learned

- Mastering layout flow with **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**
- Creating responsive design for multiple screen sizes
- Structuring clean, maintainable HTML and CSS
- Implementing **popup modals** and refining interactive UI states
- The value of committing in **incremental, meaningful stages**

## ðŸš€ Why I Loved This Project

This project allowed me to work with **real-world design constraints**, challenge my attention to visual accuracy, and experience the **thrill of transforming a static layout into an interactive interface**. Every step, from planning to the final pixel alignment, deepened my appreciation for the development process.

## ðŸ“Œ Final Thoughts

Iâ€™m proud of the progression and canâ€™t wait to build even more complex, responsive, and beautiful interfaces.
